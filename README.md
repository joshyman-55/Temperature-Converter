This JavaFX desktop application is an interactive temperature converter. Users can input a value in Fahrenheit, Celsius, or Kelvin, and instantly see the exact conversion across all three measurement scales. The user interface provides dynamic visual feedback by automatically changing the background and text color based on weather classifications ranging from "Frigid" to "Furnace". It also includes built-in input validation to prevent errors from non-numeric or empty entries.
